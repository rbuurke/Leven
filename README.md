# Levenshtein algorithm implementation for linguistic purposes

- PMI computation file in /pmi/pmi.py.
- Note that Numba (https://numba.pydata.org/) is required to run this code, next to Python 3
- All functions relating to the 2D, 2D with grapheme segmentation, and 3D Levenshtein distance algorithms are in leven.py
  - Substitution costs can be initialized, but can also be provided in a substitution cost matrix
